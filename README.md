This Spring Junior or Senior elective ECE course with corequisite Laboratory considers Verilog hardware description language (HDL), C/C++ language programming and high level synthesis (HLS) in system-on-chip (SoC) design with the ARM Cortex-A9 processors and the AMBA bus interconnection of the Xilinx Zynq device. The operating system utilized is initially single tasking followed by the multi-tasking, real-time operating system FreeRTOS. The prerequisites are CIS1057 Computer Programming in C, ECE2612/2613 Digital Logic Design and Laboratory and ECE3612/3613 Microprocessor Systems and Laboratory. ECE3622 and ECE3623 co-requisite laboratory is a required course in the Computer Engineering concentration but is available as an elective in the Electrical Engineering and Bioelectrical concentrations in ECE. 

The course texts are the The Zynq Book, The Zynq Book Tutorial, the FreeRTOS Real-time Kernel reference and tutorials on Canvas. Coordinated HDL, C/C++ and HLS SoC and RTOS projects using Xilinx Vivado (www.xilinx.com), FreeRTOS (www.freertos.org), the Digilent Zynq Z-7010 Zybo board (digilentinc.com) and Digilent Pmod sensors in ECE3623 Embedded System Design Laboratory are an integral part of the course material.

The grade for ECE3622 consists of four 20 minute SNAP Quizzes (20%), three 60 minute Exams (45%) and comprehensive 120 minute Final Exam (35%). The SNAP Quizzes, Exams, Final Exam and the open ECE3623 laboratory require a laptop computer in-class with the Xilinx Vivado and FreeRTOS design environments.
