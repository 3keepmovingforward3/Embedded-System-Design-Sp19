This Spring Junior or Senior elective ECE course with corequisite Laboratory considers Verilog hardware description language (HDL), C/C++ language programming and high level synthesis (HLS) in system-on-chip (SoC) design with the ARM Cortex-A9 processors and the AMBA bus interconnection of the Xilinx Zynq device. The operating system utilized is initially single tasking followed by the multi-tasking, real-time operating system FreeRTOS. The prerequisites are CIS1057 Computer Programming in C, ECE2612/2613 Digital Logic Design and Laboratory and ECE3612/3613 Microprocessor Systems and Laboratory. ECE3622 and ECE3623 co-requisite laboratory is a required course in the Computer Engineering concentration but is available as an elective in the Electrical Engineering and Bioelectrical concentrations in ECE.
